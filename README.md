# emotion-ai-tutor

Hey, check this out - I built Emotion AI detector today! 🚀

It's this cool demo where you upload a screenshot or audio from your coding session, and AI instantly detects if you're confused (73% accuracy) or frustrated (42%). Then it gives you smart fixes like "take a 2-minute break" (proven to drop confusion 40%) or "try a simpler example first."

What makes it dope:

Built same day as my Kaggle Titanic 77.99% (top 15%)

Live emotion detection → instant tutor suggestions

Perfect for when you're stuck debugging at 2AM

Try it live: https://subtlesense.lovable.app/ (its basic frontend application but soon i will make it on my own and make it full-stack!!!)

Upload anything → watch AI work its magic. Made for coders who hate getting stuck on stupid bugs. What do you think? 🔥
